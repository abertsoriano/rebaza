    'text' => '<p>"The law firm has allowed me to develop my internship effectively and in an integral fashion. I have been able to put into practice everything I have learned in my classes at the law school, and to learn the skills necessary to develop the type of profile the firm seeks in its lawyers. Everything has happened in a healthy and humane work-environment, were they made me feel part of the team since day one." <span class="text-bold">Pilar Oliva,</span> law student at Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú School of Law.</p>
			<p>"During my 1L summer I decided to go to Lima, Peru to do a summer internship at Rebaza, Alcazar, and De Las Casas – Finance Lawyers. At first I was hesitant about going abroad for an internship since the laws are different in different countries but in the end I decided that it would be a good opportunity. Luckily, this particular firm conducts a lot of its business internationally, and therefore, I was able to apply the skills and laws I learned from my 1L year in order to provide my assistance in the firm.</p>
			<p>I could not have made a better choice as I was able to learn a new culture while enhancing myself both professionally and academically. Most important of all was the generosity and kind nature of the work environment, I was made to feel like part of the team from day one and this truly helped in making the experience extremely rewarding. I would recommend doing an international internship at Rebaza, Alcazar, and De Las Casas to anyone coming from any other country, as it is truly an experience you will never forget!" <span class="text-bold">Jonathan Lemor</span>, law student (1L) at University of California Santa Barbara School of Law</p>',
