							<p>During the past five years, Alberto Rebaza, the Firm’s head of the Mergers and Acquisitions practice, has emerged as one of the leading Peruvian lawyers in this field. Latin Lawyer 250 has recognized his professionalism, skill and work ethics, while Chambers and Partners describes him as a professional who combines passion and energy in his work, as well as an ability to deal with complex financial issues, such as those found in Mergers and Acquisitions. Rebaza , Alcázar & De Las Casas has the experience and knowledge necessary to deal with large and complex corporate control transactions, such as the sale of Cervesur to Backus breweries, which eventually turned the latter into Peru’s leading beer producer, and subsequently, the sale of Backus stock owned by Venezuela’s Polar Brewery to the Colombian Bavaria. He was also involved in the sale of Wiese Aetna and Royal SunAlliance to Peruvian Rímac Internacional and the acquisition of the Coca Cola bottler by Peruvian Inca Kola .</p>
