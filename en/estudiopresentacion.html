							<h4 class="text-normal text-bold">Presentation</h4>
							<p>During the past decade, Alberto Rebaza and Rafael Alcázar have earned their reputation as two of the most prestigious Peruvian financial lawyers. They are widely recognized in both the Peruvian and foreign markets for the vast experience they have availed through their involvement in many of the largest transactions taken forth in Perú.</p>
							<p>he degree of expertise and experience achieved throughout these years, as well as their interest in building a modern organization together with a highly coherent professional team led them in 2004 to establish Rebaza & Alcázar Abogados Financieros, Perú’s first financial oriented law office.</p>
							<p>In August 2006, Gonzalo De Las Casas along with his team of lawyers over the past ten years, joined Rebaza & Alcazar Abogados Financieros (now Rebaza, Alcázar & De Las Casas Abogados). Gonzalo and his team are the leading Peruvian law practitioners in the areas of restructuring, insolvency and acquisition of distressed assets. The incorporation of the De Las Casas team enhanced the expertise of the firm in such areas and consolidated a strategic growth for the law firm, given that it will now be able to embrace all aspects of financial legal services.</p>
							<p>Some of the most prestigious international publications related to legal services —including Chambers and Partners, Latin Lawyer, Latin Counsel, Who’s Who Legal, IFLR 1000, GCLR 100— have referred to the high professional qualifications of these experts and have ranked them as Perú’s “most highly recommended” in the fields of Mergers and Acquisitions, Capital Markets, Banking and Finance, Privatizations and Concessions, Corporate Conflict Resolution, as well as Competition and Antitrust.</p>
