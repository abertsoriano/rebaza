							<p>The professional members of the Labor and Employment Law Group have conducted reviews and assessments of the labor situation of local and multinational corporations, as required in M&A transactions, financings, corporate reorganizations, and restructuring operations. Participating in these transactions allows our labor law practice team to design and execute strategies in order to reduce or eliminate contingencies detected during the Legal Due Diligence stage.</p>
							<p>The academic and professional experience of our team enables us to offer solid legal solutions in the fields of direct national or foreign recruitment, outsourcing, development of compensation policies, workforce reduction (individual or collective), management of collective bargains, and immigration matters applicable to expatriates.</p>
							<p>All this knowledge has allowed us to develop a vast experience defending our clients corporate interests during inspection procedures conducted by local administrative labor authorities and by the tax administration.</p>
